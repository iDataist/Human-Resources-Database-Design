# Human Resources Database Design

## Project Overview
In this project, I designed, built, and populated a database for the Human Resources (HR) Department of a video game company. I designed a database using the foundational principals of data architecture that was best suited to the department's needs. I went through the steps of database architecture, creating database proposals, database entity relationship diagrams (ERD), and finally creating the database itself.

## Business Scenario
The video game company saw explosive growth with a sudden appearance onto the gaming scene with its new AI-powered video game console. As a result, they went from a small 10 person operation to 200 employees and 5 locations in under a year. HR was having trouble keeping up with the growth since they were still maintaining employee information in a spreadsheet. While that worked for ten employees, it became increasingly cumbersome to manage as the company expands. As such, the HR department [requested](https://github.com/iDataist/Human-Resources-Database-Design/blob/main/database_request.pdf) a database capable of managing their employee information.

## Dataset
The [HR dataset](https://github.com/iDataist/Human-Resources-Database-Design/blob/main/human_resources_dataset.csv) is an Excel workbook consisting of 206 records, with eleven columns. The data is in human-readable format and was not normalized at all. The data lists the names of employees, as well as information such as job title, department, manager's name, hire date, start date, end date, work location, and salary.

## IT Department Best Practices
The IT Department has certain Best Practices policies for databases, as detailed in the [Best Practices document](https://github.com/iDataist/Human-Resources-Database-Design/blob/main/database_best_practices.pdf).

## Project Steps
The project is broken down into four major steps, which are documented [here](https://github.com/iDataist/Human-Resources-Database-Design/blob/main/hr_database_documentation.pptx).

Step 1: Business and Technical Requirement

Step 2: Relational Database Design

Step 3: Create A Physical Database

Step 3: Create Additional Features
